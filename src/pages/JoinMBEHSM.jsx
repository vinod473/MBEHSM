                    The Electro Homoeopathy is a quite harmless, unique, natural and scientific system of medicine, Dr Count Ceasre Mattei of Rochetta, Bolonga, Italy has invented it on about 1865.This system of medicine is based on the principles of “The Human organization is entirely composed of two elementary liquids Lymph & Blood and the health and diseases are depend on the such liquids.” The Electricity has been observed in all the living beings including plants. It is proved that no cell, no tissue, no organ and /or a body could possibly manifest its legitimate function without electrical energy. It is a fundamental and basic principle of the science that the manufacture, transmission , utilization and discharge of Electrical energy of living cells is responsible for metabolism of the body and also give us a rational explanation for all the phenomena of life , Health ,diseases and therapeutics. The Electro Homoeopathic medicine generate and regenerate greater power restoring functional capacity and arresting organic changes than all the drugs mentioned in other Pharmacopoeia.The Electro Homoeopathy remedies are prepared by the vegetables on a specific process called ‘SPAGIRIC WAY” which was introduced by Dr.Theophrastus Von Hoheneeim (Paracelsus) and Dr. Von Helmont. The Spagiric method is part of German Pharmacopoeia duly recognized by the Government of India Under the Drugs & Cosmetic Act 1940 as Schedule II item No 4 A (b) These remedies have maximum curative capacity and the capacity to regulate the lymph and blood and also to keep them purified.Life and health are in the blood and the lymph that disease is in the vitiation of the blood or the lymph or of both together.

                    Electro-Homeopathy is a system of medicines used to treat a variety of illnesses and ailments. The principle of Electro-homeopathy is that when disease occurs in the body there is more than one of the organs involved or affected by the condition, this is because the whole body is interconnected and is also very complex. Therefore, it is thought that the body needs a medicine which is both natural but complex too, hence the use of medicine made from plants. Electro-Homeopathy works according to the belief that there are two vital fluids present in the human body; the lymph and the blood.

                    The prefix Electro is used to indicate Bio-energy,which is present in plant process sap,used as medicines.During the process of photosynthesis all the entire natural forces in the form of Odic force and capture in the plants are stored as potential energy.During the process of Chohobation they are dissolved into spagiric essence and stored there, as potential energy too. When they are used as medicines and introduced into the body they different organs or systems through the proper circulation of blood and lymph and changes into kinetic energy and as it keep the body fluids into equilibrium by maintaining Homeostasis and keep the body healthy and fit.
