                        Electro Homoeopathy is formed from three words:<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Electro = energy<br/>
                        Homoeo = similar<br/>

                        Electro Homoeopathy is a plant-orientated system of herbal medicine.
                        The Electro Homoeopathic remedies purify the lymph and blood systems
                        of the human body. With Electro Homeopathy we can find and destroy

                        <br/>
                        Electro Homoeopathy has four fundamental laws:<br/>
                        Law of Similar - Complex Complexis Curantur<br/>
                        Complex remedies - Combinations<br/>
                        Infinitesimal Dose - Diluted form of positive and negative dose<br/>
                        Selection of remedy -Temperament of the patient i.e. lymphatic,
                        sanguine, mixed or nervous

                    <p>
                        This means that a complex body requires a complex mixture.
                        For example, the human body is classed as compact and is
                        therefore complex. So when disease occurs in the body, more
                        than one part is involved. Diseases can produce many symptoms
                        and therefore complex medicine is required to work on the
                        complex disease.

                        The name Electro Homoeopathy comes from the Electro [energy]
                        content extracted from the plants, and the way this energy is

                    <p>
                        Electro Homoeopathy is a name given by the founder, on the
                        basis that the remedies are a class of energy conforming to
                        the ‘law of similar’ and they posses a power and promptness
                        which allows them to be compared to

                    <p>
                        The Italian noble Count Ceaser Mattei discovered these remedies
                        in the latter part of the 1800s in Bologna, Italy. Under the
                        influence of the philosopher Paolo Costa, Count Mattei was
                        encouraged to devote his time and wealth to the service of
                        humanity. He was elected as a member of the Roman Parliament
                        but soon abandoned political life and gave himself up entirely
                        to medical studies. He acquainted himself with the researches
                        of the illustrious Hahnemann, the discoverer of original
                        Homeopathy, and also with human polarity. Being a herbalist
                        himself, he prepared these remedies from herbs and named them
                        Electro Homoeopathic medicines. After Mattei had completed his
                        experiments, he subjected his remedies to severe and numerous
                        tests. Between 1865 and 1867, more than 20,000 patients were
                        treated under the supervision of Dr Coli and Dr Conti. In 1869
                        the Pope opened a ward in the Hospital of Sant Theresa at Rome
                        where the remedies could be tested more fully. The results were
                        astonishing.

                    <p>
                        Electro Homoeopathic remedies work on the principle that
                        diseased organisms are far more sensitive than healthy
                        organisms and change the condition of the bodily fluids.
                        A remedy should not be given to remove the symptoms of the body
                        but to work on the cause of the disease.

                    <p>
                        Electro Homoeopathy is a system of medicine that draws all of
                        its remedies from non-poisonous plants. It does not use sources
                        from the mineral or animal kingdom. The remedies work with
                        nature and help the healing

                        Electro Homoeopathy can be used by anyone of any age group who
                        suffers from acute to chronic illnesses, for example, depression,
                        arthritis, migraine, ulcers or ME.

                        Electro Homoeopathy treatment is always based on the Law of
                        Temperament. The patient may be lymphatic, sanguine, mixed or
                        of a nervous temperament. The person belonging to a specific
                        temperament will show symptoms based on that constitution. In

                        Electro Homoeopathic remedies are all extracted from non-poisonous
                        plants and do not create drug addiction or side effects. All
                        remedies use the physical properties and not the chemical ones and
                        are therefore ideal to combat the human body disorders without any
                        side effects.

                    <h3 style={h3css}>How do Electro Homoeopathic remedies work?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The manner of preparing these compound remedies is the method
                        of “cohobation”. This method uses plant extracts in the higher
                        energies (vital force). This is a very potent invisible force,
                        \abstract in the natural form which transforms every
                        constitution of the living being as an ‘Od Force’ (vital force).
                        Each remedy is derived from the active enzymes of several plants.
                        When the complex remedy is administered to the patient it
                        completely covers and controls the body. The remedy will then
                        move through the body acting on the parts that require it. As
                        soon as the diseased part is sufficiently saturated with the
                        remedy, it stops absorbing it. When all the parts of the body
                        have been healed, the medicine itself is no longer absorbed.

                        In a healthy, normal body there is a perfect equilibrium of all
                        powers and tensions. But when the harmony of the whole is
                        troubled by some pathological process, it results in either an
                        increased sensitivity, as mostly happens with acute diseases,
                        or a lessened sensitivity and reaction, as with most chronic
                        diseases. The Fluids are used to remove these derangements in
                        the sphere of the nervous system and to regulate the tonic power
                        in our body. There are five Fluids, which are made as colourless
                        mixtures of essences in a weak alcoholic solution. According to
